function S = srhtb2(n, s)
	% S = srhtb2(n, s)
	%* Generates a Subsampled Random Hadamard Transform, to be used as a random subspace embedding
	%
	% Input:
	% 	n is the original space size
	% 	s is the embedding dimension
	% Output:
	% 	S: function handle such that S(x) = SS*x, where SS is the s x n matrix corresponding to the randomized embedding
	%
	% Very simple generalization that also handles block inputs
